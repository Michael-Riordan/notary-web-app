# notary-web-app
Notary web application for LRmobilenotary notary services. Initially created without repository.
Created with vite+react. Uses an Express server to make secure calls to Google Place Autocomplete API, Google Directions API, as well as using EmailJS SDK.
This web app gives users an option to retrieve a free quote based off their desired services, the distance to signing location from business address, as well as an option to
email the business with the previously mentioned information, eventually including an appointment date/time.

I neglected to start this repository until further into the development process, the first initialization consists of a mostly completed web application, 
I will be refactoring (mostly simplifying CSS and JS/JSX), adding google's terms of service, recaptcha for the email service, as well as adding more functionality to the website (appointment setter and SQL database for appointment information storage/appointment blockage).
